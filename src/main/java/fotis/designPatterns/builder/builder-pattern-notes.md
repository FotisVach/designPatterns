# Builder Pattern notes

### Intent

* Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.

### Explanation

* *Builder Patter* allows you to create different flavors of an object while avoiding constructor pollution. Useful when there could be several flavors of an object. Or when there are a lot of steps involved in creation of an object.
* The *Builder Pattern* is an object creation software design pattern with the intentions of finding a solution to the telescoping constructor anti-pattern.
