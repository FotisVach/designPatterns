# Decorator Pattern

### Intent

1. When we want to enhance behavior of our existing object dynamically as and when required then we can use decorator design pattern. 
1. Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

### Design Considerations

### Applicability

Use the Decorator pattern when:

1. Add responsibilities to individual objects dynamically and transparently, that is, without affecting other objects.
1. For responsibilities that can be withdrawn.
1. When extension by subclassing is impractical. Sometimes a large number of independent extensions are possible and would produce an explosion of subclasses to support every combination. Or a class definition may be hidden or otherwise unavailable for subclassing.

ex. java.io.InputStream, java.io.OutputStream, java.io.Reader and java.io.Writer
